**What inspired me to work on this project**

It's RunningMan. There's this episode that simulates the past X years of stock market and the players are given certain amount of time to make decisions, they got a timer that countdowns from start of a date to the end of a date. 
That got me thinking, I guess I can try to create one.

I also wanted to try out other GUI libraries, for fun.
