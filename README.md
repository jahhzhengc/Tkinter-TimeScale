<h2>What inspired me to work on this project</h2>
 
It's RunningMan. There's this episode that simulates the past X years of stock market and the players are given certain amount of time to make decisions, they got a timer that counts from start of a date to the end of a date. 
That got me thinking that I can create one too.

I also wanted to try out other GUI libraries, for fun.

<h3>I chose to recreate CalendarWidget cause</h3>

DateEntry was giving me behaviours that I don't know how to fix.
Its not the first time I create a calendar from scratch using UI libraries so it didn't take long to convince myself to do so.
